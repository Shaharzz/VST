 KarmaFX Synth Modular 2
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Advanced Simulated Analog Modular Synthesizer and Effect Unit: 
  * Full Modular patching of synth Components and Controls. 
  * Patches are built using Generators, Filters, Amplifiers, Controllers, Effects and Modulators.
  * Internal high-frequency digital simulation of analog voltage levels. 
  * Oscillator with phase, Detune and Pulsewidth that generates standard synth waveforms. 
  * Dual Oscillator with Detune, Hardsync and Ring modulation.
  * Sampler, 16/24/32 bit Mono/Stereo multi sample player that imports WAV/SF2/SFZ files.
  * Multisample editing with Key/Velocity-ranges and Loop-Points.
  * Additive and Pad module with waveform and Harmonic Magnitude/Phase editors.
  * User defined waveforms and built-in presets of up to 1024 harmonics.
  * Granular module for sample-based granular synthesis with variable grain size/rate.
  * 2/4 Pole Resonant Multimode Filters with Cutoff, Resonance, Saturation and Drive 
   (LP/HP/BP/BS): SVF, SVF2, SKF, Zolzer, Moog, Moog2, Acid, and MS20.
  * Additional filters include Formant, Comb, Allpass, Parametric and Shelving.
  * EQ3, 3 band equalizer with adjustable crossover frequencies, and 2 and 4 pole modes.
  * 10-band digital and 31-band simulated analog Graphic Equalizers.
  * Amplifier and Stereo module with Panning, Volume and Velocity control. 
  * Two channel Mixer with Ring modulation and Circuit Bending Bit Shuffle operations.
  * Inverter for Amplitude Modulation, and Mid/Side module for stereo separation.
  * Delay, Reverb, Phaser, Chorus/Flange, Pitchshift, BitShuffler and Distortion effects.
  * Soft-knee Compressor with Peak/RMS detection and optional Sidechain.
  * Folder, Limiter, Repeater, Soft Clipper and 3-band Multiband Compressor with Peak/RMS detection.
  * 10 Octave/12 Note Pitch control with Detune Portamento and Pitchbend support.
  * Choose between Mono, Legato, or up to 16-voice true Polyphony.
  * Controllers for Frequency Modulation (FM/PM) and frequency/phase control.
  * Support for Linear FM, Phase Modulation, and Exponential FM with Exponential frequency Sync.
  * Generators support Through-Zero frequency, and optional High Quality (HQ) 16x oversampling.
  * Up to 16 channel Unison controller with Detune and Stereo pan spread.
  * 32 step, 4 octave Pattern controller with Hold, Loop, Legato, Sustain and programmable Arpeggiator.
  * Custom arpeggiator note masking with programmable scales and 30+ scale presets.
  * Scope Module with synced, multi-layered oscilloscope, frequency and phase displays.
  * Keyboard module for MIDI visualization and manual MIDI triggering, with Pitchbend/ModWheel.
  * Bipolar/Unipolar LFO with Tempo Sync, HFO with FM/Phase Modulation option + Fade and Keyb. Tracking.
  * ADSR and Multipoint Envelopes with Linear, Exponential, Hermite and Cubic curves.
  * 32 step Step Sequencer, Envelope follower, Sample & Hold and Decay modules.
  * Shaper module for custom waveshaping.
  * Output module with Panning, DC removal, Volume and Clip control. 
  * Noise generator, filtered Pink, White and Brown Noise with Frequency Sync control.
  * PanSpread stereo expander with individual low and high spread + crossover frequency adjustment. 
  * Sonic Maximizer emulation module with Low Contour, Process and Peak Detector.
  * Input generator so synth can function as an Insert effect.
  * SubPatch generator and effect modules for re-using patches within other patches.
  * Number of simultaneously running modules supported per patch is practically unlimited.
  * Full stereo support (selected modules can run in mono to save CPU cycles).
  * Expression option, so parameters can respond to MIDI Mod.Wheel, Aftertouch and Velocity inputs.
  * Instant visual feedback on all controls. Frequency, Time/Amplitude, Modulation, etc.
  * Visually see signals, and knob's and slider's modulation-values in real-time, as they are modulated.
  * Fast trigger and output response, with zero latency and tight latency compensation.
  * Up to 128 simultaneously running internal voices (Polyphonic and Unison combined).
  * MIDI modulator modules for MIDI Controller, Velocity, Aftertouch and Pitchbend input.
  * MIDI Polyphonic Expression support (MPE) for per-note Pitchbend, Aftertouch and Timbre.
  * Synth frequency can be offset from "Concert Pitch" (from 440Hz to e.g., 432Hz).
  * 128 user-assignable Automation controls with MIDI Learn.
  * Control Panel & Patch Browser for quickly navigating patches and banks with search filtering.
  * Fully skinnable GUI: Skins bundled with the installation support HiDPI/Retina GUI scaling up to 200%.
  * Fully customizable GUI resolution of up to 4096 x 2048 (default is 1500 x 1000).
  * Customizable GUI patch-cables can be shown as linear, curved and dangling.
  * 5 banks of pre-made KarmaFX patches + Extra userbanks. (More than 1000+ patches total).
  * Additional Online Banks can be downloaded and installed from inside the synth.
  * Full VST 2.4+ support on PC/Windows and Audio Unit/VST 2.4+ support on Mac/OS X.
  * Full VST3 support on PC/Windows and Mac/OS X.
